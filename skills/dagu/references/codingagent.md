# Coding Agent Integration

Use `action: harness.run` to run AI coding agents as DAG steps. A harness step can run Dagu's in-process agent, an external CLI on the host, an external CLI in a step-level container, or an external CLI in the DAG-level shared container.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Runtime | Invocation |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `builtin` | In-process Dagu agent | Uses Dagu's agent executor. It is not a CLI process. |
| `claude` | `claude` | `claude -p "<prompt>" [flags]` |
| `codex` | `codex` | `codex exec "<prompt>" [flags]` |
| `copilot` | `copilot` | `copilot -p "<prompt>" [flags]` |
| `opencode` | `opencode` | `opencode run "<prompt>" [flags]` |
| `pi` | `pi` | `pi -p "<prompt>" [flags]` |

The selected CLI provider's binary must be resolvable when it runs. Dagu CLI providers use `PATH`. Custom harnesses can use a binary name or an explicit path resolved from the step working directory.

## Feature Reference

- `with.prompt` is required. In `action: harness.run`, it becomes the step command and is preserved as prompt text, including multiline text.
- `with.stdin` becomes the step script. `provider: builtin` appends it to the user message after a blank line. Host subprocess runs pass it to stdin. Containerized harness runs reject stdin.
- `provider: builtin` runs Dagu's in-process agent. It accepts builtin agent fields such as `model`, `max_iterations`, `safe_mode`, `skills`, `tools`, `memory`, and `web_search`. It rejects pass-through CLI flags.
- Dagu CLI providers are `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `opencode`, and `pi`. Non-reserved `with` keys become CLI flags.
- Custom providers must be declared under top-level `harnesses:`. Custom names cannot collide with built-in provider names.
- `fallback` is an ordered list of provider configs. Dagu tries the next config only when the previous attempt fails and the run context is still active. Fallback configs cannot contain another `fallback`.
- `provider` may use value references only if they resolve to a concrete provider string before executor creation. If `${...}` remains unresolved at runtime, the harness fails with an unresolved provider template error.
- `provider` and `fallback` are harness control keys. They are not passed as CLI flags.

## How `with` Works

Harness supports Dagu providers and named custom harness definitions:

- `with.provider` selects `builtin`, a Dagu CLI provider, or a custom `harnesses:` entry
- top-level `harnesses.<name>` defines how to invoke a custom harness CLI

For Dagu CLI providers and custom providers, non-reserved `with` keys are passed directly as CLI flags:

- `key: "value"` → `--key value`
- `key: true` → `--key`
- `key: false` → omitted
- `key: 123` → `--key 123`
- Dagu CLI providers also normalize `snake_case` keys to kebab-case flags, so `max_turns` becomes `--max-turns`

Reserved keys are `prompt`, `stdin`, `provider`, and `fallback`.

## Custom Harness Registry

Define reusable custom harness adapters once at the DAG level:

```yaml
harnesses:
  gemini:
    binary: gemini
    prefix_args: ["run"]
    prompt_mode: flag
    prompt_flag: --prompt
    option_flags:
      model: --model

steps:
  - id: review
    action: harness.run
    with:
      prompt: "Review the current branch"
      provider: gemini
      model: gemini-2.5-pro
```

Custom harness definition fields:

- `binary` — CLI binary or path
- `prefix_args` — args that always appear before prompt placement and runtime flags
- `prompt_mode` — `arg`, `flag`, or `stdin`
- `prompt_flag` — required when `prompt_mode: flag`
- `prompt_position` — `before_flags` or `after_flags`
- `flag_style` — `gnu_long` or `single_dash`
- `option_flags` — per-option override from `with` key to exact flag token

## DAG-Level Defaults and Fallback

Use top-level `harness:` to define shared defaults for every harness step in the DAG.

```yaml
harness:
  provider: claude
  model: sonnet
  bare: true
  fallback:
    - provider: codex
      full-auto: true
    - provider: copilot
      yolo: true
      silent: true

steps:
  - id: step1
    action: harness.run
    with:
      prompt: "Write tests"

  - id: step2
    action: harness.run
    with:
      prompt: "Fix bugs"
      model: opus
      effort: high

  - id: step3
    action: harness.run
    with:
      prompt: "Generate docs"
      provider: copilot
      fallback:
        - provider: claude
          model: haiku
```

Merge rules:

- DAG-level primary harness config is the base
- Step-level `with` overlays it
- Step-level `with.fallback` replaces DAG-level `fallback`
- Step-level `with.fallback: []` disables inherited fallback
- New DAGs should use `action: harness.run`; legacy `type: harness` inference exists only for backward compatibility.

## Containerized Harness Steps

`container:` is optional for `harness.run`. It can be defined at the DAG root or on a specific harness step.

Use root-level `container:` when all compatible steps should run in the same DAG-level container. Dagu starts or attaches to that container for the run. A harness step without its own `container:` executes the provider CLI inside that shared container.

```yaml
container:
  image: my-codex-runner:latest
  pull_policy: always
  working_dir: /workspace
  volumes:
    - .:/workspace:rw

steps:
  - id: fix_tests
    action: harness.run
    with:
      provider: codex
      prompt: "Fix the failing tests in this repository"
      sandbox: workspace-write
      skip-git-repo-check: true
    timeout_sec: 600
```

Use step-level `container:` when only that harness step needs a container, or when it needs a different container from the DAG-level one. If both root-level and step-level containers are present, the step-level container is used for that step.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: fix_tests
    action: harness.run
    container:
      image: my-codex-runner:latest
      pull_policy: always
      working_dir: /workspace
      volumes:
        - .:/workspace:rw
    with:
      provider: codex
      prompt: "Fix the failing tests in this repository"
      sandbox: workspace-write
      skip-git-repo-check: true
    timeout_sec: 600
```

Container rules:

- The selected provider binary must exist inside the container that runs the step.
- Dagu CLI providers and custom providers with `prompt_mode: arg` or `prompt_mode: flag` can run in a container.
- `provider: builtin` cannot run in a container because it is an in-process provider.
- `with.stdin` is not supported in a container.
- Custom providers with `prompt_mode: stdin` are not supported in a container.
- A step-level image-mode container creates a container for the step. Dagu uses the provider binary as the container entrypoint and passes provider arguments as the command.
- Do not set `container.name` for image-mode harness steps. Use `container.exec` when the step must execute inside an existing container.
- For a root-level container, Dagu executes the full provider command inside the shared DAG-level container.
- A step-level container inherits user-defined runtime values such as DAG env, step env, params, secrets, and step outputs. The engine process environment is not injected.
- A root-level shared-container harness env filters host-path runtime values such as `PWD`, DAG run log paths, artifact paths, and step stream paths. Do not rely on those host paths inside the shared container.
- Step-level `container.env` overrides inherited values with the same key.
- DAG resource limits are applied to created step-level harness containers and created DAG-level containers when the container runtime supports those limits. Existing-container exec mode cannot change that container's host resources.
- Provider flags still belong under `with:`. For example, Codex `sandbox: workspace-write` configures Codex inside the outer container boundary.
- Docker or Podman is selected by the Dagu service process. This is not configured in the DAG YAML.

## Pattern 1: Single Agent Step

```yaml
params:
  - PROMPT: "Explain the main function in this project"

harness:
  provider: claude
  model: sonnet
  bare: true

steps:
  - id: run_agent
    action: harness.run
    with:
      prompt: "${params.PROMPT}"
    output: RESULT
```

## Pattern 2: Multi-Agent Pipeline

Chain agents, passing output between steps via env-scope `output:` variables or `${step_id.stdout}` file references.

```yaml
type: graph

params:
  - topic: ""

steps:
  - id: research
    action: harness.run
    with:
      prompt: "Research every approach to: ${params.topic}. List all approaches with pros, cons, and when to use each."
      provider: claude
      model: sonnet
      bare: true
    output: RESEARCH

  - id: review
    action: harness.run
    with:
      prompt: "Review the research provided on stdin for completeness and gaps"
      # Interpolated before execution, then piped to the harness CLI on stdin.
      stdin: |
        Review this research for completeness and gaps:

        ${env.RESEARCH}
      provider: codex
      full-auto: true
      skip-git-repo-check: true
    depends: [research]
    output: REVIEW

  - id: refine
    action: harness.run
    with:
      prompt: "Refine this research incorporating the review feedback provided via stdin."
      stdin: |
        === Research ===
        ${env.RESEARCH}

        === Review Feedback ===
        ${env.REVIEW}
      provider: claude
      model: sonnet
      bare: true
    depends: [review]
    output: REFINED
```

`with.prompt` is the prompt. For host subprocess runs, Dagu CLI providers and custom `arg`/`flag` harnesses receive `with.stdin` on stdin as supplementary context. For host subprocess custom `stdin` harnesses, stdin receives the prompt, then a blank line, then `with.stdin` when both are present.

## Pattern 3: Parameterized

```yaml
params:
  - PROVIDER: claude
  - MODEL: sonnet
  - PROMPT: "Analyze this codebase"

steps:
  - id: agent
    action: harness.run
    with:
      prompt: "${params.PROMPT}"
      provider: "${params.PROVIDER}"
      model: "${params.MODEL}"
    output: RESULT
```

## Provider Examples

### Claude Code

steps:
  - id: task
    action: harness.run
    with:
      prompt: "Write tests for the auth module"
      provider: claude
      model: sonnet
      effort: high
      max-turns: 20
      max-budget-usd: 2.00
      permission-mode: auto
      allowed-tools: "Bash,Read,Edit"
      bare: true
    timeout_sec: 300
    output: RESULT
```

### Codex

      prompt: "Fix failing tests in src/"
      provider: codex
      full-auto: true
      sandbox: workspace-write
      ephemeral: true
      skip-git-repo-check: true
    timeout_sec: 300
```

### Copilot

```yaml
steps:
  - id: task
    action: harness.run
    with:
      prompt: "Refactor the authentication middleware"
      provider: copilot
      autopilot: true
      yolo: true
      silent: true
      no-ask-user: true
      no-auto-update: true
    timeout_sec: 300
```

### OpenCode

```yaml
steps:
  - id: task
    action: harness.run
    with:
      prompt: "Refactor the database layer"
      provider: opencode
      format: json
    timeout_sec: 300
```

### Pi

```yaml
steps:
  - id: task
    action: harness.run
    with:
      prompt: "Design a rate limiting middleware"
      provider: pi
      thinking: high
      tools: read,bash
    timeout_sec: 300
```

## Notes

1. **Model names** — Look up current model names from each provider's documentation. Do not rely on hardcoded names; they change frequently.
2. **Prompt as a parameter** — Expose the prompt via `params:` so users can customize from UI/CLI without editing the DAG.
3. **Timeouts** — Set `timeout_sec:` (300-600s+) on agent steps. Agent CLIs can run for minutes.
4. **Retry on transient failures** — Add `retry_policy: { limit: 3, interval_sec: 30 }` to handle rate limits and network errors.
5. **Working directory** — Use `working_dir:` on the step. The CLI operates relative to this directory.
6. **Output capture** — Use string-form `output: VAR_NAME` for small flat values, declared `outputs:` for explicit `${steps.<step_id>.outputs.<name>}` values, object-form `output:` for structured `${step_id.output.*}` access, and `stdout.artifact` / `stderr.artifact` when large agent output, reports, JSON, Markdown, or logs should be stored as DAG-run artifacts. Use `${step_id.stdout}` only when a downstream step needs the stdout log file path.
7. **Exit codes** — 0 = success, 1 = provider error, 124 = step timed out or cancelled.
8. **Failure output** — Recent stderr is included in the error message on failure. When failed stdout exists, Dagu also includes a recent stdout tail and writes that tail to stderr.
9. **Fallback behavior** — If the primary harness config fails and the context is still active, fallback entries are tried in order. Failed-attempt stdout is discarded; stderr remains visible in logs.
